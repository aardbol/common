This repository contains the common Actions and config files for developing the Red Hat GitHub Actions. This repository has been forked to implement the latest dependency versions and apply security fixes.

- [action-io-generator](./action-io-generator) is an NPM package and (soon to be) Docker Action that makes sure your JavaScript action uses the same Inputs and Outputs defined in your `action.yml`.
- [bundle-verifier](./bundle-verifier) is a JavaScript Action that makes sure your JavaScript action's committed distribution bundle is up-to-date.
- [commit-data](./commit-data) is a Docker Action that outputs some commonly needed data about the current workflow's HEAD commit.
- [config-files](./config-files) contains our shared TypeScript, ESLint, and Webpack configs.

It is also used for tracking issues that don't fit into another, more specific repository.
